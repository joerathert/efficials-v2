# EFFICIALS V2.0 - PROJECT CONTEXT & STATUS

## üéØ MISSION: Complete Rebuild from SQLite to Firebase

I am rebuilding the Efficials sports officials scheduling app from scratch as v2.0. The v1.0 codebase at `/mnt/c/Users/Efficials/efficials_app` worked well on Android emulator but became a patched-together SQLite mess when migrating to Firebase. I reset to a clean slate and started v2.0 at `/mnt/c/Users/Efficials/efficials_v2` with Firebase from the ground up.

## üèóÔ∏è V2.0 ARCHITECTURE GOALS

### Core Technology Stack
- **Flutter** - Cross-platform (Android, iOS, Web)
- **Firebase Firestore** - Real-time NoSQL database  
- **Firebase Authentication** - User management
- **Firebase Cloud Functions** - Server-side atomic operations
- **FCM** - Push notifications

### Key Features Required
- **Real-time Collaboration** - Multiple schedulers editing simultaneously
- **Offline-First** - Non-critical tasks work offline, sync later
