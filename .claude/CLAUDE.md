# EFFICIALS V2.0 - PROJECT CONTEXT & STATUS

## üéØ MISSION: Complete Rebuild from SQLite to Firebase

I am rebuilding the Efficials sports officials scheduling app from scratch as v2.0. The v1.0 codebase at `/mnt/c/Users/Efficials/efficials_app` worked well on Android emulator but became a patched-together SQLite mess when migrating to Firebase. I reset to a clean slate and started v2.0 at `/mnt/c/Users/Efficials/efficials_v2` with Firebase from the ground up.

## üèóÔ∏è V2.0 ARCHITECTURE GOALS

**Critical Lessons Learned - Firebase Web Configuration** - DOCUMENTED FOR FUTURE REFERENCE:

#### üî¥ **Firebase Web Initialization Issues (Major Lesson)**
**Problem**: Firebase initialization failures during web startup caused entire Flutter app to crash
**Root Cause**: Incorrect API keys, UTF-8 encoding issues in `.env` file, missing asset declarations
**Impact**: "Site can't be reached" errors, blank white screens, development workflow blocked
**Solution**: Proper Firebase web configuration with correct API keys, asset declarations, and encoding

#### üîß **Key Technical Lessons**
- **Firebase API Keys**: Web and mobile use different API keys - must be configured separately
- **Environment Files**: `.env` files must be UTF-8 encoded and declared as assets in `pubspec.yaml`
- **Flutter Web Sensitivity**: Web platform is more sensitive to Firebase configuration errors than mobile
- **Asset Loading**: All referenced files must be properly declared in `pubspec.yaml` assets section
- **Error Cascading**: Firebase failures can crash entire web app before UI loads

#### üõ†Ô∏è **Development Workflow Improvements**
- **Quick Access Testing**: Implemented one-click sign-in buttons for development testing
- **Responsive Design**: Web buttons now properly sized vs mobile (400px max width vs full width)
- **Layout Centering**: Content properly centered on web while maintaining mobile responsiveness
- **Port Management**: Established consistent port usage to avoid conflicts

#### üìù **Future Prevention Measures**
- **Always verify Firebase web configuration** before web deployment
- **Test .env file encoding** and asset declarations during setup
- **Implement Firebase error handling** in main.dart to prevent app crashes
- **Document API key differences** between platforms for team reference
- **Use proper asset management** for all environment and configuration files
