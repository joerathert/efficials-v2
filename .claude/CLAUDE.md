games.sort((a, b) {
  // Handle null dates - put games without dates at the end
  if (dateA == null && dateB == null) return 0;
  if (dateA == null) return 1;
  if (dateB == null) return -1;

  // Compare dates first
  final dateComparison = dateA.compareTo(dateB);
  if (dateComparison != 0) return dateComparison;

  // If dates are the same, compare times
  final timeAInMinutes = timeA.hour * 60 + timeA.minute;
  final timeBInMinutes = timeB.hour * 60 + timeB.minute;
  return timeAInMinutes.compareTo(timeBInMinutes);

**Critical Lessons Learned - Firebase Web Configuration** - DOCUMENTED FOR FUTURE REFERENCE:

#### üî¥ **Firebase Web Initialization Issues (Major Lesson)**
**Problem**: Firebase initialization failures during web startup caused entire Flutter app to crash
**Root Cause**: Incorrect API keys, UTF-8 encoding issues in `.env` file, missing asset declarations
**Impact**: "Site can't be reached" errors, blank white screens, development workflow blocked
**Solution**: Proper Firebase web configuration with correct API keys, asset declarations, and encoding

#### üîß **Key Technical Lessons**
- **Firebase API Keys**: Web and mobile use different API keys - must be configured separately
- **Environment Files**: `.env` files must be UTF-8 encoded and declared as assets in `pubspec.yaml`
- **Flutter Web Sensitivity**: Web platform is more sensitive to Firebase configuration errors than mobile
- **Asset Loading**: All referenced files must be properly declared in `pubspec.yaml` assets section
- **Error Cascading**: Firebase failures can crash entire web app before UI loads

#### üõ†Ô∏è **Development Workflow Improvements**
- **Quick Access Testing**: Implemented one-click sign-in buttons for development testing
- **Responsive Design**: Web buttons now properly sized vs mobile (400px max width vs full width)
- **Layout Centering**: Content properly centered on web while maintaining mobile responsiveness
- **Port Management**: Established consistent port usage to avoid conflicts

#### üìù **Future Prevention Measures**
- **Always verify Firebase web configuration** before web deployment
- **Test .env file encoding** and asset declarations during setup
- **Implement Firebase error handling** in main.dart to prevent app crashes
- **Document API key differences** between platforms for team reference
- **Use proper asset management** for all environment and configuration files

#### üõ†Ô∏è **Flutter Layout & Navigation Lessons**
- **ModalRoute Access**: Never call `ModalRoute.of(context)` in `initState()` - use `didChangeDependencies()` instead
- **RenderFlex Overflow**: Use `mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min` for inner containers to prevent unbounded height constraints
- **Spacer Replacement**: Replace `Spacer()` with `SizedBox(height: 40)` when layout constraints are tight
- **ConstrainedBox**: Use `ConstrainedBox` with `maxWidth: 400` for dropdowns to prevent overflow on wider screens
- **Navigation Guards**: Add `_argumentsFetched` flags to prevent multiple executions of argument parsing

#### üîß **CURRENT WEB ENGINE TROUBLESHOOTING (ACTIVE ISSUE)**
**Flutter Web Engine Errors During Hot Restart:**
- **Primary Symptoms**: "Cannot send Null" errors, assertion failures in `window.dart:99:12`
- **Impact**: Hot restart not working reliably, app loading on wrong screens, development workflow blocked
- **Root Causes Being Investigated**:
  - Browser cache conflicts with Flutter web engine state
  - Hot restart preserving navigation stack incorrectly
  - Flutter web engine receiving null values during state transitions
  - Development server state corruption after multiple hot restarts

**Troubleshooting Attempts:**
- ‚úÖ Cleared browser cache and used incognito mode
- ‚úÖ Killed all Dart processes before restart
- ‚úÖ Implemented navigation reset logic in `main.dart` with `_hasResetNavigation` flag
- ‚úÖ Used `Navigator.of(context).pushNamedAndRemoveUntil('/', (route) => false)` for hard reset
- ‚úÖ Modified `MaterialApp` from `home` to `initialRoute: '/'` with explicit route definition
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Current Status**: Still experiencing intermittent web engine errors and navigation issues

**Next Steps for Resolution:**
- Test alternative browsers (Edge, Firefox) to isolate Chrome-specific issues
- Implement more aggressive navigation stack clearing
- Add comprehensive error handling around Flutter web engine operations
- Consider browser cache clearing automation or alternative development workflow

## üö® **CRITICAL: AUTHENTICATION DEBUGGING GUIDE** - PREVENT 3-HOUR DEBUGGING SESSIONS

### **üéØ IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS** (Do These FIRST)

#### **1. Firebase Web Configuration Checklist**
- ‚úÖ **API Key**: Must be the **Web API Key** from Firebase Console (not Android/iOS)
- ‚úÖ **Project ID**: Exact project ID from Firebase Console
- ‚úÖ **Auth Domain**: `your-project-id.firebaseapp.com`
- ‚úÖ **Storage Bucket**: `your-project-id.appspot.com`
- ‚úÖ **Messaging Sender ID**: 12-digit number from Firebase Console

#### **2. .env File Requirements**
- ‚úÖ **Location**: Must be in project root (`C:\Users\Efficials\efficials_v2\.env`)
- ‚úÖ **Format**: Plain text file, **NO quotes around values**
- ‚úÖ **Encoding**: UTF-8 (Windows default is usually fine)
- ‚úÖ **Content**: 6 lines, one per Firebase config value

#### **3. Firebase Console Account Setup**
- ‚úÖ **Test Account**: `ad.test@efficials.com` with password `test123`
- ‚úÖ **Firestore Document**: User profile in `users/{uid}` collection
- ‚úÖ **Required Fields**: `email`, `role`, `profile`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`

### **üîç AUTHENTICATION ERROR DIAGNOSTIC GUIDE**

#### **Error: "Sign in failed. User profile not found"**
**Root Cause**: Firebase Auth account exists, but Firestore user document missing
**Solution**:
1. Check Firebase Console ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Users (account exists?)
2. Check Firestore ‚Üí users collection (document exists?)
3. Verify document has: `email`, `role`, `profile`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`

#### **Error: "TypeError: null type 'Null' is not a subtype of type 'Timestamp'"**
**Root Cause**: Firestore document missing required timestamp fields
**Solution**:
- Add `createdAt` field (timestamp)
- Add `updatedAt` field (timestamp)
- Both must be Firestore timestamp type (not string)

#### **Error: "Failed to load .env file: Instance of 'FileNotFoundError'"**
**Root Cause**: .env file missing, wrong location, or wrong format
**Solution**:
- File must be: `C:\Users\Efficials\efficials_v2\.env`
- No quotes around values
- UTF-8 encoding
- 6 configuration lines

### **üõ†Ô∏è QUICK DIAGNOSTIC CHECKLIST** (5 minutes)

**Before Starting Debug Session:**
1. ‚úÖ Does `.env` file exist in project root?
2. ‚úÖ Does `.env` have 6 Firebase config lines?
3. ‚úÖ Are values in `.env` wrapped in quotes? (Should be NO)
4. ‚úÖ Does Firebase test account exist in Console?
5. ‚úÖ Does Firestore user document exist with required fields?

**During Debug Session:**
1. ‚úÖ Check console logs (AuthService & UserService now log errors)
2. ‚úÖ Verify Firebase Console has correct project
3. ‚úÖ Test with different email to isolate issues
4. ‚úÖ Use Firebase Console's built-in testing tools

### **üîß PREVENTION MEASURES** (Add to Future Development)

#### **Environment Setup Checklist:**
```bash
# Required for new developers
- [ ] .env file created in project root
- [ ] Firebase project configured correctly
- [ ] Test accounts created in Firebase Console
- [ ] Firestore user documents created with proper structure
- [ ] Console logging enabled in AuthService & UserService
```

#### **Development Workflow:**
- **Always check .env file** after `flutter clean`
- **Verify Firebase Console setup** before authentication testing
- **Use console logs** for immediate error diagnosis
- **Test with known working accounts** first

### **üéØ LESSONS FROM 3-HOUR DEBUG SESSION**

#### **Root Causes Identified:**
1. **Missing .env file** ‚Üí Web Firebase config not loaded
2. **Wrong .env format** ‚Üí Values not parsed correctly
3. **Missing Firestore fields** ‚Üí UserModel.fromMap() failed
4. **Timestamp field requirements** ‚Üí Null timestamp casting error

#### **Prevention Strategies:**
1. **Automated .env validation** during app startup
2. **Comprehensive error logging** (already implemented)
3. **Firebase configuration validation** in development
4. **User document structure validation** in UserService
5. **Development setup checklist** for new team members

### **üõ†Ô∏è IMMEDIATE IMPROVEMENTS IMPLEMENTED**

- ‚úÖ Firebase Console integration verification

### **üö® FUTURE PREVENTION MEASURES**

#### **Automated Validation (Future Implementation):**
```dart
// In main.dart - validate setup on startup
void validateDevelopmentSetup() {
  // Check .env file exists and is valid
  // Verify Firebase configuration
  // Test Firestore connectivity
  // Validate user document structure
}
```

#### **Team Onboarding Checklist:**
- [ ] Clone repository
- [ ] Run `flutter pub get`
- [ ] Create `.env` file with Firebase config
- [ ] Set up Firebase test accounts
- [ ] Run `flutter run -d chrome` and verify Quick Access works
- [ ] Check console logs for any setup issues
