# EFFICIALS V2.0 - PROJECT CONTEXT & STATUS

## üéØ MISSION: Complete Rebuild from SQLite to Firebase

I am rebuilding the Efficials sports officials scheduling app from scratch as v2.0. The v1.0 codebase at `/mnt/c/Users/Efficials/efficials_app` worked well on Android emulator but became a patched-together SQLite mess when migrating to Firebase.

**Critical Lessons Learned - Firebase Web Configuration** - DOCUMENTED FOR FUTURE REFERENCE:

#### üî¥ **Firebase Web Initialization Issues (Major Lesson)**
**Problem**: Firebase initialization failures during web startup caused entire Flutter app to crash
**Root Cause**: Incorrect API keys, UTF-8 encoding issues in `.env` file, missing asset declarations
**Impact**: "Site can't be reached" errors, blank white screens, development workflow blocked
**Solution**: Proper Firebase web configuration with correct API keys, asset declarations, and encoding

#### üîß **Key Technical Lessons**
- **Firebase API Keys**: Web and mobile use different API keys - must be configured separately
- **Environment Files**: `.env` files must be UTF-8 encoded and declared as assets in `pubspec.yaml`
- **Flutter Web Sensitivity**: Web platform is more sensitive to Firebase configuration errors than mobile
- **Asset Loading**: All referenced files must be properly declared in `pubspec.yaml` assets section
- **Error Cascading**: Firebase failures can crash entire web app before UI loads

#### üõ†Ô∏è **Development Workflow Improvements**
- **Quick Access Testing**: Implemented one-click sign-in buttons for development testing
- **Responsive Design**: Web buttons now properly sized vs mobile (400px max width vs full width)
- **Layout Centering**: Content properly centered on web while maintaining mobile responsiveness
- **Port Management**: Established consistent port usage to avoid conflicts

#### üìù **Future Prevention Measures**
- **Always verify Firebase web configuration** before web deployment
- **Test .env file encoding** and asset declarations during setup
- **Implement Firebase error handling** in main.dart to prevent app crashes
- **Document API key differences** between platforms for team reference
- **Use proper asset management** for all environment and configuration files

#### üõ†Ô∏è **Flutter Layout & Navigation Lessons**
- **ModalRoute Access**: Never call `ModalRoute.of(context)` in `initState()` - use `didChangeDependencies()` instead
- **RenderFlex Overflow**: Use `mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min` for inner containers to prevent unbounded height constraints
- **Spacer Replacement**: Replace `Spacer()` with `SizedBox(height: 40)` when layout constraints are tight
- **ConstrainedBox**: Use `ConstrainedBox` with `maxWidth: 400` for dropdowns to prevent overflow on wider screens
- **Navigation Guards**: Add `_argumentsFetched` flags to prevent multiple executions of argument parsing

#### üîß **CURRENT WEB ENGINE TROUBLESHOOTING (ACTIVE ISSUE)**
**Flutter Web Engine Errors During Hot Restart:**
- **Primary Symptoms**: "Cannot send Null" errors, assertion failures in `window.dart:99:12`
- **Impact**: Hot restart not working reliably, app loading on wrong screens, development workflow blocked
- **Root Causes Being Investigated**:
  - Browser cache conflicts with Flutter web engine state
  - Hot restart preserving navigation stack incorrectly
  - Flutter web engine receiving null values during state transitions
  - Development server state corruption after multiple hot restarts

**Troubleshooting Attempts:**
- ‚úÖ Cleared browser cache and used incognito mode
- ‚úÖ Killed all Dart processes before restart
- ‚úÖ Implemented navigation reset logic in `main.dart` with `_hasResetNavigation` flag
- ‚úÖ Used `Navigator.of(context).pushNamedAndRemoveUntil('/', (route) => false)` for hard reset
- ‚úÖ Modified `MaterialApp` from `home` to `initialRoute: '/'` with explicit route definition
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Current Status**: Still experiencing intermittent web engine errors and navigation issues

**Next Steps for Resolution:**
- Test alternative browsers (Edge, Firefox) to isolate Chrome-specific issues
- Implement more aggressive navigation stack clearing
- Add comprehensive error handling around Flutter web engine operations
- Consider browser cache clearing automation or alternative development workflow
