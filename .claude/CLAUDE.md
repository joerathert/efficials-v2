# EFFICIALS V2.0 - PROJECT CONTEXT & STATUS

## üéØ MISSION: Complete Rebuild from SQLite to Firebase

I am rebuilding the Efficials sports officials scheduling app from scratch as v2.0. The v1.0 codebase at `/mnt/c/Users/Efficials/efficials_app` worked well on Android emulator but became a patched-together SQLite mess when migrating to Firebase. I reset to a clean slate and started v2.0 at `/mnt/c/Users/Efficials/efficials_v2` with Firebase from the ground up.

## üèóÔ∏è V2.0 ARCHITECTURE GOALS

### Core Technology Stack
- **Flutter** - Cross-platform (Android, iOS, Web)
- **Firebase Firestore** - Real-time NoSQL database  
- **Firebase Authentication** - User management
- **Firebase Cloud Functions** - Server-side atomic operations
- **FCM** - Push notifications

### Key Features Required
- **Real-time Collaboration** - Multiple schedulers editing simultaneously
- **Offline-First** - Non-critical tasks work offline, sync later
- **Atomic Operations** - Prevent race conditions in game claiming
- **Role-Based Access** - Schedulers create/edit, Officials view/claim
- **"Publish Later"** - Queue games offline, publish online with notifications

## üìä CURRENT STATUS (CRITICAL FOR CONTEXT)

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED FEATURES
1. **Complete Firebase Architecture Design** - No organizations model, scheduler isolation
2. **User Authentication System** - Firebase Auth + Firestore user profiles
3. **Full User Models** - Athletic Director, Coach, Assigner, Official profiles
4. **Athletic Director Signup Flow** - 5-screen complete flow working ‚úÖ
5. **Firebase Integration** - User creation, profile storage, real-time sync ‚úÖ
6. **Athletic Director End-to-End Testing** - Account creation, Firestore storage, navigation working ‚úÖ

### ‚úÖ RECENT FIXES COMPLETED
**Firebase Package Compatibility Issue** - RESOLVED! Fixed Dart SDK constraint and Firebase package compatibility:
- Fixed Dart SDK constraint from `^3.9.0` to `^3.4.0` for Flutter 3.22.0 compatibility
- Downgraded flutter_lints to `^4.0.0` 
- Updated Firebase packages to compatible versions
- Athletic Director signup now works end-to-end with successful account creation

**School Name vs Schedule Name Enhancement** - IMPLEMENTED! Enhanced Athletic Director profile to properly distinguish:
- **Full School Name**: "Edwardsville High School" (official records)
- **Schedule Name**: "Edwardsville" (appears on game schedules)  
- **Mascot**: "Tigers"
- **Generated Home Team**: "Edwardsville Tigers" (scheduleName + mascot)
